# Hand_Tracking
My open-cv journey with python. Here, i try to use the "mediapipe" library provided by Google to detect and track hand movements using the webcam on my laptop. the images and the traced points are displayed via the open-cv library and helps to illustrate the hand's landmarks.

lines 53 and 55 are optional because i used them to check how i can target each individual point that has been detected on my hand (called a landmark) and paint a circle on that point using cv2.circle() function.
