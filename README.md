# Hand_Tracking
My open-cv journey with python. Here, i try to use the "mediapipe" library provided by Google to detect and track hand movements using the webcam on my laptop. the images and the traced points are displayed via the open-cv library and helps to illustrate the hand's landmarks.

lines 53 and 55 are optional because i used them to check how i can target each individual point that has been detected on my hand (called a landmark) and paint a circle on that point using cv2.circle() function.

MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building cross-platform multimedia processing pipelines. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for real-time video, audio, and sensor data processing, as well as machine learning inference.

To learn more about MediaPipe, you can visit the official website at <https://mediapipe.dev>. The website provides documentation, tutorials, sample code, and other resources to help you get started with the framework.
